a = input("Enter a Number: ")
b = input("Enter a Number: ")

print("Number a is: ",a)
print("Number b is: ",b)
print("Sum is: ",a+b)
# so the output is 56 because it takes input as string

# so here is the solution of this problem

a = int(input("Enter a Number: "))
b = int(input("Enter a Number: "))

print("Number a is: ",a)
print("Number b is: ",b)
print("Sum is: ",a+b)
